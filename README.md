# Ratings-Application

This java program uses a simple but effective suggestion algorithm to suggest content to users based upon four factors:

  1) Ratings given by other users.
  2) Ratings given by current user.
  3) Correlation between users (i.e. if User A and User B like more of the same content User A's ratings 
  will be weighted proportionately heavier than other users when generating suggestions)
  4) Overall rating of a piece of content.
  
  The methods sumofMultiply and rateBooks in class Interface encompass the majority of the suggestion algorithm.
